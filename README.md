# 🌐 API Proxy Server
Built a Node.js + Express based API proxy server with support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests, cookie-based authentication handling, and in-memory caching for optimized repeated requests. Designed a React frontend to provide an interactive interface for sending requests, managing headers/body, and viewing formatted responses, inspired by API testing tools like Postman.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Proxy any external API
- ✅ Forward & receive cookies for authenticated APIs
- ✅ Handles GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
- ✅ In-memory caching for popular/frequent requests
- ✅ Simple frontend integration with React (Vite)
- ✅ History management (stored in LocalStorage on frontend)

## ⚠️ Note: 
- params field is not added → must include full query string in URL (e.g. https://api.com/users?id=123)
